        "Visualisation is an essential part of any data role. Whether we are delivering regular reports to decision-makers, presenting the results of a regression model to a room of stakeholders, or creating a real-time dashboard for the wider business, we are using data to tell a story, and visuals bring these stories to life.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this post we are going to explore a number of ways to visualise text data in the context of analysing job posts for three data roles: data scientists, data engineers and data analysts. These roles have a lot in common but are fundamentally different; will the content of the job descriptions for these roles reflect the differences between them? And how can we visualise these differences?\n",

        "First we need to collect some job descriptions to analyse. There are plenty of job search APIs out there to choose from and we also have the option to scrape directly from job websites. I ended up using the Reed developer API because of the simple process of signing up for credentials. I wrote a python wrapper for the API which I will be using to extract a collection of relevant job posts; you can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/reed/).\n",

One way to do this is with a bag-of-words approach, which consists of separating the text in our documents into tokens and counting the appearances of each token in each document. Before we do this there are some errands we need to run first. Sklearn's Countvectorizer class performs the tokenization step for us, but we need to be careful when using it. By default it splits the text on punctuation marks and discards tokens less than two characters long. For this reason, the word 'Ph.D' which is frequently used would be split into the two meaningless tokens 'Ph' and 'D', for example. The important term 'R' denoting the programming language would also be discarded. We can remedy these issues and others similar using pandas string methods. At the same time we'll remove any rows with duplicate job descriptions."

        "We can spot a few themes such as the emphasis on machine learning in DS job descriptions while SQL and reporting feature prominently in DA posts. The plot corresponding to Data engineer roles is not as insightful. The appearance of Python, SQL and Azure are promising, but no sign of ETL pipelines and a lower prevalance of cloud-based systems than we'd expect. And why does scientist turn up so much? Across the three plots we can also see another problem with this simple word frequency approach: the most insightful terms are diluted by a saturation of words which are common across the three roles and thus essentially useless, such as 'data', 'experience', 'role' and 'team'. \n",
        "\n",
        "We need a metric which highly ranks frequent words but suppresses words which appear in lots of the documents in our corpus. Luckily for us a metric exists which does exactly as we require. TFIDF or term-frequency inverse-document frequency takes the term frequency of a word in a document and multiplies it by the inverse document freqency of that word, essentially damping those words which appear across a large proportion of the documents. Again sklearn has our back and can perform this process for us."

        "As before the TfidfVectorizer returns a term-document matrix, but instead of consisting of word frequencies we have tfidf values for each term-document pair. The parameters 'min_df' and 'max_df' are constraints on the document frequency of the words in our vocabulary. We have used a 'min_df' of 2, so any words that do not appear in at least two documents are thrown out. 'Max_df' is a float which corresponds to a proportion of the documents, so here if any words appear in more than 60 percent of the documents they too are discarded. In the same way as before, we can sum the tfidf values within the three classes and plot the highest aggregate values to hopefully extract the most important terms to characterise the three job types."

In this case we are going to use Principal Component Analysis, or PCA for short, to project our data onto the two dimensions which retain the highest variability.

        "Remarkably, the three different job titles are almost perfectly separated into clusters in this two dimensional representation. This is significant because the PCA algorithm has no idea that our dataset contains three distinct classes, but by simply projecting the data onto the coordinate axes retaining the most variability the algorithm has managed to almost perfectly separate them. We can go one step further and demonstrate that the three classes are well-separated by applying k-means clustering first two principle components. The result is the following."

        "Let's recap what we've achieved here. We started with a collection of raw text documents, each one a description of a job from one of three different titles. Using term-frequency inverse-document-freqency we converted each description into a fixed length vector of TF-IDF values. Then using PCA we projected our new 2038-dimensional data matrix onto the two coordinate axes of highest variability so we could produce a scatterplot of the data. The result was a clear visual separation into three clusters corresponding to the three job titles, which we have now shown are nearly perfectly recreated using a simple clustering algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cool part about this is not that we have accurately classified each TF-IDF vector with its job title. There are lots of supervised approaches that would likely be more effective if that were our goal. No, the interesting part is thinking about how these simple unsupervised methods can be applied to problems where we *don't* have access to labelled data as we did here. For example, given an unlabelled text dataset we could take the same steps, compute the TF-IDF values, plot the first two principle components and look for clusters. Then by comparing the most import words in each cluster via the TF-IDF values we might uncover patterns in the data that we weren't aware of. What clusters might we find if we applied this to restaurant reviews? Or house listings?\n",
        "\n",
        "Hopefully some of these ideas for visualising and investigating text data have piqued your interest and you've learned some of the differences between data science, engineering and analysis roles along the way.  "
