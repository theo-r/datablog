I studied maths and statistics at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/) and
I'm a junior data scientist at [MAG](https://www.magairports.com/). In my time spent away from speeding
up SQL queries I'm typically listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/guitarutter) 
or chasing a frisbee around a field.
